Created Controller,Service and dao classes to handle the scenario.

Crated Merchant Service class to handle 
- create offer
- delete offer
- get available offers
- get active offers  - reading offers from files


Created controlller to handle the API requests

Code Flow :

Controller - > Service class -> Dao class


Drawbacks or Improvements : I could have created it as maven dependency project to resolve spring dependencies and also add json jars.
